# Job Portal Vue 3 Template

Welcome to the **Job Portal Vue 3 Template**! This template is designed to help you kickstart your development journey with Vue 3 in Vite, a fast and lightweight development server. Below, you'll find essential information to set up your development environment and get started with this project.

## Recommended IDE Setup

For the best development experience, we recommend using **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** as your code editor. It offers excellent support for Vue.js development with the following extensions:

1. [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar): Volar is a powerful language support extension specifically tailored for Vue.js 3 development. It provides enhanced features and performance compared to other Vue.js extensions.

2. **Disable Vetur**: As we are using Volar, it's recommended to disable Vetur to avoid potential conflicts between extensions.

3. [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin): This extension provides TypeScript support specifically for Vue projects using Volar.

## Customize Configuration

The project's configuration is built on **Vite**, a build tool for modern web development. If you want to customize the project's settings, you can refer to the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for detailed information.

## Project Setup

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

3. Run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

During development, you can use the following command to compile the project and enable hot-reloading for a smooth development experience:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command will start a development server, and any changes you make to the source code will be automatically recompiled and reflected in the browser.

### Compile and Minify for Production

Once you are satisfied with your development and ready to deploy the application, use the following command to compile and minify the project for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command will generate optimized and minified files in the `dist` directory, which you can then deploy to a web server or hosting platform.

Now you have everything you need to start building your Vue 3 job portal application! Happy coding! ðŸš€
