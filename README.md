The objective of the project is to create a career services platform wherein employers can post job openings and students looking for work can showcase and update their portfolios. This platform makes it simple for both job seekers and companies to search for prospective matches. Furthermore, it enables candidates to customize their profiles to meet market demands and helps employers find competent candidates based on their requirements.
